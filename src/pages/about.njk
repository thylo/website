                From 2005 to 2009, I studied multimedia development at the IAD in
                Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium.

                During my studies I was extremely lucky to meet extremely talented people like {% friend  "albandf" %} and
                {% friend  "badou" %}.
                At that time Adobe Flash was still a thing so AS3 was my first code love
                and expression mean. \n I still miss the freedom Flash gave us at the time. \n
                I also had the chance to learn CSS from the great and only {% friend  "jeromecoupe" %}. Seeing him explaining CSS
                floats is a life changing event. I also met {% friend  "pvledoux" %} who made a short but powerful appearance as PHP teacher.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started to work in 2009 for Emakina.eu where I developed a few
                "interactive experiences" in Flash. During that time I also met {% friend  "kant312" %} and {% friend  "dja" %} with whom we endured a few Drupal websites.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2011, I got married with the wonderful and lovely {% friend  "aureliemoreels" %}. I also
                started to work for my dad's construction company Soluce. The company
                grew fast and was lacking a proper way to track interventions. I
                developped for him a ticketting system. At that time, the PHP and JS
                ecosystem was booming so It seemd like I learned a new framework every
                week to keep up the pace. I learned Yii, BackboneJS, AngularJS,
                discovered some little known PHP framework called Laravel. In parallel
                to my work at Soluce I also did several freelance missions.
            </p>
            <p>
                I ended up joining {% friend  "kant312" %}, {% friend  "pvledoux" %} and {% friend  "jeromecoupe" %} at Tcheu! \n In 2014, I worked for a few
                months for Wepika, long story short, Prestashop ended up at the top of the stack
                of software I don't ever want to use ever again.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2016, I started to work for BetterStreet. I discovered the joys and pains of mobile development using
                React Native. I also modernized the citizen and
                admin frontends putting a strong focus on UX. It was a pleasure to work and collaborate with {% friend  "pitbi" %}  APIS.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2019, I joined Belighted and finally got to work with {% friend  "she" %} whom I have crossed path with a
                couple of time.
                Along my frontend developer job at Belighted, I started teaching "the dynamic web" at the IAD, crossing once
                again the path of {% friend  "badou" %} &amp; {% friend  "jeromecoupe" %}.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy taking care of my 3 children, having a good belgian beer while playing
                roleplaying
                games and discovering new itineraries to cycle to work.
